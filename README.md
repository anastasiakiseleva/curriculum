## Tools and technologies

This section lists some tools that are widely used by technical writers. It is by no means comprehensive, but it can give you an idea of what can be of use.

- [HTML, CSS, JavaScript at w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/)  
  Free tutorials to get you familiar with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Documentation resources often run on static site generators, so it makes sense to understand how websites work.

- [Git tutorial](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)  
A simple tutorial that gives an overview of basic Git operations and offers practical tasks to solve for training purposes. Nice visualization, too!

- [Creating and building locally a documentation website with Sphinx, rST, and Sublime](https://sublime-and-sphinx-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
A full tutorial that leads you through the complete process of creating a documentation website, populating it with content in rST, and building it locally. It also suggests using [GitHub](https://github.com/) for versioning and publishing the results with [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), but these steps are not described, so you can experiment yourself.

- [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)  
A very simple and intuitive tool to create and publish your documentation.

## Best practices

This section provides examples of genuinely good examples of how docs are done and some high-level stuff that will help you organize your documentation better.

- [The best approach to structuring your documentation I have seen so far](https://diataxis.fr/)
- [Starting from scratch: creating Minimum Viable Documentation](https://thisisimportant.net/2021/09/21/from-nothing-to-something-with-minimum-viable-documentation/)
- [What NOT to do: how to avoid confusion and make your explanations clear and simple](https://jvns.ca/blog/confusing-explanations/)
- [A concise and practical approach to writing README with great examples](https://github.com/hackergrrl/art-of-readme)
- [A great example from Plaid of how you should handle errors description](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/)

## Documenting API

- [Documenting APIs by Tom Johnson](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/)  
The best free course that will teach you how to document APIs even if you have never had anything to do with it before. Fantastic!

## Advanced

- [Automating stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)  
A great resource to learn Python with immediate practical application.

## Volunteering for experience

- [Reddit thread with opensource projects that need documenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/gcfmuh/a_list_of_open_source_projects_with_volunteer/)  
This is a good place to find a real actual project and practice your skills.
